Hi, I'm Joseph Dolan! I'm a sophomore computer science student at the University of Scranton.

There's not much to see here yet but I plan on adding a few projects in the near future.

Some classes I'm currently taking:
- DS201: Introduction to Data Science
  - check out [my semester project](https://github.com/jdolan44/congress_data_package/tree/main)!
- CMPS340: Introduction to Database
  - check out [this java application](https://github.com/jdolan44/myretails) that uses JDBC and PostgreSQL!
- CMPS352: Operating systems
  - currently working on a group project that plays gomoku across servers using sockets!
