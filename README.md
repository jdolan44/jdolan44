Hi, I'm Joe Dolan! I'm a Junior computer science student at the University of Scranton.

### Some porjects I'm interested in:
- learning Rust for systems programming! After my OS class last fall, I had an interest in similar projects and Rust seems like a great modern language for interacting with the OS.
- building [a personal portfolio site](https://jdolan44.github.io) using Github Pages!
- polishing up my final project from my Mobile App Development class!

### Some class projects I've worked on:
- CMPS355: Mobile App Development
  - worked on [a mobile order app](https://github.com/jdolan44/Lunchilicious) with database and web servcie interaction, using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
- DS201: Introduction to Data Science
  - check out [my semester project](https://github.com/jdolan44/congress_data_package/tree/main)!
- CMPS340: Introduction to Database
  - check out [this java application](https://github.com/jdolan44/myretails) that uses JDBC and PostgreSQL!
- CMPS352: Operating Systems
  - worked in a small group on a client-server system for a two-player game called Gomoku.
