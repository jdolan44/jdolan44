Hi, I'm Joe Dolan! I'm a rising Junior computer science student at the University of Scranton.

you can contact me at my student email: [joseph.dolan@scranton.edu](mailto:joseph.dolan@scranton.edu)  
or at my personal email: [jdolan16646@gmail.com](jdolan16646@gmail.com)

### My current projects I'm working on this summer:
- learning Rust for systems programming! After my OS class in the fall, I had an interest in similar projects and Rsut seems like a great modern language for interacting with the OS.
- building a personal portfolio site using Github Pages!
- polishing up my final project from my Mobile App Development class!

### Some classes I have taken:
- CMPS355: Mobile app development
  - currently working on a mobile order app with database interaction, using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
  - I hope to add my final project repository soon!
- DS210: Math Methods for Data Science
- DS201: Introduction to Data Science
  - check out [my semester project](https://github.com/jdolan44/congress_data_package/tree/main)!
- CMPS340: Introduction to Database
  - check out [this java application](https://github.com/jdolan44/myretails) that uses JDBC and PostgreSQL!
- CMPS352: Operating systems
  - currently working on a group project that plays gomoku across servers using sockets!
